### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Serif display font for elegance + Sans-serif body font for readability
**Primary Font**: Playfair Display (serif) - Premium, elegant feel for headings and brand name
**Secondary Font**: Inter (sans-serif) - Modern, highly legible for body text and UI elements
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Large display headings (6xl-8xl), medium section headings (4xl-5xl), standard body text (base-lg)
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent weight relationships, proper line heights (1.5x for body), generous letter spacing for headings

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Hero section draws focus to brand name, then menu becomes primary content focus
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to create breathing room and premium feel
**Grid System**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts with consistent gap spacing
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement for larger screens
**Content Density**: Balanced - enough information without overwhelming, strategic use of cards for organization

### Animations & Interactions

**Badges**: "New" and "Popular" indicators for menu items
**Layout Components**: Hero sections, grid layouts, centered content containers
**Component States**: Clear hover, active, and focus states for all interactive elements

### Visual Consistency Framework
**Design System**: Consistent component patterns across all pages
**Wood Grain Textures**: Three variations (heavy, light, navigation) for visual interest
**Border Radius**: Consistent 0.75rem radius for modern, friendly feel
**Spacing Scale**: Tailwind's spacing system for mathematical consistency
**Shadow System**: Subtle elevation changes on hover for depth

### Accessibility & Readability

**Font Sizing**: Minimum 16px base size, generous line heights
**Interactive Elements**: Minimum 44px touch targets
**Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
**Animation Considerations**: Respects user motion preferences

## Implementation Considerations
**Technology Stack**: React with TypeScript, Framer Motion for animations, shadcn/ui components
**Performance**: Optimized images, efficient animations, minimal bundle size
**Mobile Experience**: Touch-friendly interactions, responsive layouts
**SEO Considerations**: Semantic HTML structure, proper heading hierarchy

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
**Slow Connections**: Graceful animation fallbacks, optimized assets
**Small Screens**: Responsive navigation, readable text sizes
**Accessibility**: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation
**Browser Compatibility**: Modern browser support, progressive enhancement

## Reflection
